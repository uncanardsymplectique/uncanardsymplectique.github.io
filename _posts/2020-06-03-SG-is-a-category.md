I've been playing around with data I collected from [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/), and more particularly metadata of preprints submitted in or cross-listed with `math.SG` (see [here](/metamaths/) for more).

Below is the diagram obtained by drawing a dot with coordinates $(x,y)$ for each category `cat` where:
- $x$ is the number of preprints submitted in `cat` which has `math.SG` as secondary category,
- $y$ is the number of preprints submitted in `math.SG` which has `cat` as secondary category.
